## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hey, I’m Zukki / Eddie!

Welcome to my digital workspace — hell where somehow my code does actually compile. 😄  
I’m a **42 student** focused on low-level programming, optimization, and building projects that actually *work* (most of the time).

---

## 🧠 Projects I finished
🧩 **Libft** — My very first library in C.  
🖨️ **ft_printf** — Because printing text shouldn’t be easy.  
🧾 **get_next_line** — Reading one line at a time, peacefully.  
♻️ **Push Swap** — Sorting numbers with pain and precision.  
🌖 **Fractol** — Visualizing beautiful mathematical fractals using MLX.  
🖥️ **Born2BeRoot** — Setting up a secure Linux server from scratch with strict system rules.

Each project pushed me a little further into madness, and a lot closer to mastering C.

## ⚙️ Tools of the Trade
- **Languages:** C (main), HTML, JS, and CSS  
- **Environment:** Linux (WSL), VS Code, Vim  

> “When in doubt, `make re`.” — Me, every night.

If you’re from 42 or just passing through, feel free to check out my repos —  
I promise you’ll find at least one Makefile that works.
